              <p className="text-md">
                These funds typically invest in tangible assets that derive
                their value from their substance and physical properties. Real
                assets include real estate, public and private infrastructure,
                natural resources, precious metals, and commodities. Investors
                looking to add a broad real assets allocation to their private
                markets portfolio and gain access to key market sectors,
                including energy, power, infrastructure, and natural resources
                turn to solidvestglobal.com. Real assets also serve as a crucial
                portfolio diversifier as they tend to respond to different
                economic conditions than other private asset classes. The
                performance of real assets, for example, has been positively
                correlated with inflation which has made them an effective hedge
                during periods when prices have risen.
